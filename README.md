## How I apprpached this Challenge
This was quite a difficult challenge for me, as I have never worked with"create-react-app" before and API's in general. The link given to us was an excellent way to start an empty project. Within the first minute, I was able to get an empty app running without any problems. I started getting lost in how the folder was structured. The README on the facebook repo was helped a great deal in understanding the basics. 

I was comfortable with the HTML and CSS part of the challenge. I was able to update the favicon and OC logo. I tried my best to make the app look as professional as possible. It was getting and loading the API data that I was having trouble.

I went to numerous websites, watched as many youtube videos I could to try to understand and learn it, but was going nowhere. I went to a couple forums, but had no luck there either.

## What do I have done
I have a basic app with no functionality, I wish I had a little more time to give this project so I could have had more done than what I have so far.

## What I learned
Making Apps with react is very fast, if you understand the structure of it. I will continue to debug this project/app when I dont have to work on school projects.
